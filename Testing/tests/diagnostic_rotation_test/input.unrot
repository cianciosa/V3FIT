2013-01-15 JJK input.SHAxTest_28
   Settled on better base conditions, cleaned up what is crap and what matters. Coupled with better magnetics inputs, this file is working quite well.

2012-09-14 JJK input.SHAx1
   Settled on base initial conditions, cleaned up file.

2012-06-22 JDH input.MST_e3
   Moved intial parameters, for ER test with simulated data, from _e2 results.

2012-06-22 JDH input.MST_e2
   Added lmove_axis=.F.
   Per email from SPH on 2012-06-12
   "...setting lmove_axis=F PREVENTS VMEC from shifting the axis to improve
   the initial forces, so the nonzero nâ€™s are not initially cancelled and the
   equilibrium can go to the RFP helical state."
   
2012-06-21 JDH input.MST_e1
   Rearranged order, but didn't change any parameters.

  _b6 worked. Decrease major radius from 1.99 to 1.9. Change axis guess
  
  _b8 - RBC00 from 1.9 to 1.8
  _b9 - RBC00 from 1.8 to 1.7
  _c1 - change NFP from 7 to 6, rescale the iota
  _c2 - RBC00 from 1.7 to 1.6
  _c3 - RBC00 from 1.6 to 1.5
  _c4 - change NFP from 6 to 5, rescale the iota
  _c5 - Decrease RBC and ZBS 1-0, to make boundary more circular.
  _c6 - Decrease RBC and ZBS 1-0 to 0., to make boundary circular.
  _c7 - c6 didn't work. Go more slowly, 
        RBC-ZBS(1,0) from 0.005 to 0.003
  _c8 - RBC-ZBS(1,0) from 0.003 to 0.002

  _b5 worked. Try
  1) truncate extra digits, move slightly in MST direction, geometry.

2011-11-28 JDH input.RFX_28218_200_5_b5
  _b4 worked. Try
  1) Change phiedge to MST value
  
2011-11-28 JDH input.RFX_28218_200_5_b4
   _b3 worked. Try
   1) Change sign of iota
   2) Change sign of ZAXIS_CS(2)
   3) Changes sign of ZBS(1,0)

2011-11-28 JDH input.RFX_28218_200_5_b3
   _b2 was axisymmetric. Move more slowly.   
   1) NTOR = 6
   2) Axis guess - only 2 terms (instead of 3)

2011-11-28 JDH input.RFX_28218_200_5_b2
   _b1 was axisymmetric. Move more slowly.
   1) Make boundary circular, RBC and ZBS(10) = 0.
   2) NTOR = 6


2011-11-28 JDH input.RFX_28218_200_5_b1
   Move toward MST
   1) Make boundary circular, RBC and ZBS(10) = 0.
   2) NTOR = 6
   3) Change sign of iota
   4) Change sign of ZAXIS_CS(2)

2011-11-28 JDH input.RFX_28218_200_5_a1
   Started from input.RFX_28218_200_5, from DT
